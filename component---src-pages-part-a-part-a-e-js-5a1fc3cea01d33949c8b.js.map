Take care to maintain your airbrush properly so it can be used smoothly on your next painting project. If you don't clean you rairbrush enough, the remaining paint inside the brush will prevent you from pulling your airbrush button backwards. When y ou don't settle any airbrush flaws you find while taking it apart for maintenance, you'll have to pay a fee for professional maintenance. If you take care of your airbrush, it can last 10, 20 years. It's an expensive item, so use it carefully and keep it for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Use thinner to clean the inside of your airbrush every time you change colors and after you finish painting. If you don't, paint will harden inside the airbrush and interfere with painting.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Cleaning your airbrush.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Remove unused paint. Store any paint left in the cup inside a jar, and spray any paint still in the airbrush towards the painting booth. Then wipe the inside of the cup with tissue paper.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>So long as you didn't mix it with another paint, it's fine to put thinned paint inside the original undiluted paint jar.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Pour thinner inside the cup then backflush. Pour thinner in until it fills 2/3 of the cup.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>7. Spray some thinner at the painting booth</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>8. Repeat backflushing and spraying until the thinner comes out clear. You'll probably need to do it three times.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Tip: Clean the buttom of the cup with a brush. If backflushing alone isn't enough to clean the bottom, fill the cup up to 1/3 full with thinner and then use a paintbrush to clean it away.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>9. Clean the nozzle. Use a paint brush (or a cotton swab) soaked in thinner to clean away any dried paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_11.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>10. Clean the cap. Use tissue paper soaked in thinner to clean away any dried paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>11. Clean the airbrush body. Put the cap back on, then wipe the whole airbrush with tissue paper to remove fingerprints and dried paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2>Heavy Duty Maintenance</h2>\r\n\r\n        <p>Take apart the airbrush and clean it. Take care not to lose the airbrush parts. Taking apart and cleaning an airbrush isn't a particularly difficult process. Don't rush and carefully disassemble, then clean.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_13.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>1. Unscrew the shaft cap. Before disassembling, turn off the power for the compressor, and unscrew the airbrush from the hose. Then unscrew the shaft cap at the back of the airbrush. </p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_14.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>2. Remove both the shaft cap and the needle stopper. Take out the shaft cap and the needle stopper. Make sure not to lose the removed shaft cap.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_15.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>3. Unscrew the needle chuck. Remove the needle chuck, which keeps the needle fixed in place. It's small and rolls easily, so take care not to lose it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_16.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>4. Pull the needle out of the airbrush. Pull the needle out of the airbrush. Do this work carefully so that you don't bend the tip of the needle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_17.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>5. Check the condition of the needle. Check the condition of the pulled out needle. It's easy for there to be paint residue up to 3cm away from the tip, so check carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_18.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Attention Don't bend the tip of the needle. If the needle bends, paint won't fly straight forwards. When you remove the nozzle cape and the needle cap, and pull out the needle, be very careful. If by chance it bends, you'll have to replace it with after market parts. [Or just new parts]</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Point: A trick to protect against the needle tip from bending A tip is to take out the needle while pulling the airbrush button back. The needle moves together with the button, so the needle tip will be inside the airbrush, which protects against it touching the cap and getting the tip bent.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_19.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>6. Use tissue paper to wipe off the needle's paint residue Soak a tissue paper in thinner, then use it to gently wipe off paint residue attached to the needle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_20.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>7. Check that the bottom of the cup isn't dirty. Check the bottom of the airbrush cup, which is normally hidden from view by the needle. Make sure that it's not dirty.</p>\r\n     \r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_21.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>8. Clean the bottom of the cup with a paintbrush and thinner. When you're bothered by how dirty the inside of the cup is, wash it wish thinner. Pour in thinner, and then use a brush to clean the bottom of the cup.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_22.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>9. Use tissue paper to wipe away the thinner. Soak up the thinner inside the cup with tissue paper, then use it to wipe away paint from the inside of the cup or the outside of the airbrush.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_23.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>10. Put the airbrush back together. After maintenance, put the pieces you removed back on in the opposite order you took them off to reassemble the airbrush to its original condition.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Attention: Important point about gripping the needle If you don't insert the needle far enough in, the paint that enters the cup will end up rattling around noisily. Also, if you force the needle in, it might get caught and become unable to move. The needle tip should stick out from the paint nozzle by about 1-2 mm. </p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Point: Is the button moving slowly? Take out the airbrush button, then spread a little bit of grease [lubricant] from the \"airbrush maintenance set\" on the base of the button. The button should move as smoothly as it did prior.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Taking apart and cleaning the nozzle When paint has hardened on the airbrush's nozzle, remove the nozzle cap and the needle cap, then disassemble and clean. The needle is very slim, so take care not to bend the tip of the needle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_24.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>1.Paint dried on the mouth of the nozzle. When paint has hardened on the needle cap, disassemble and wash.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_25.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>2. Remove the needle cap. Unscrew the airbrush's nozzle cap and needle cap.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_26.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>3. Further disassemble the cap. To make washing easier, separate the nozzle cap and the needle cap.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_27.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>4. Clean the cap. Using a brush, clean away the paint attached to the nozzle by melting it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_28.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>5. Return the cap to its original position. Return the nozzle cap and the needle cap to their original places.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pae_29.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Use Tool Cleaner for stubborn stains. For times when your tools after usage have paint hardened on them, use tool cleaner, which has a higher cleaning power than thinner. Its volatility is high, so during and after use be sure to ventilate.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_A_E","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
