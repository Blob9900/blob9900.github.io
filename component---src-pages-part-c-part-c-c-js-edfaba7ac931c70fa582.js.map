The JP uses \"particle\" for both. Also I go back and forth between \"brilliance\" and \"brightness\", but it's the same word: kagayaki]</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>If you use the pearl colors that have a luster like a pearl, or metallic colors that have had metallic particles inserted, the raw plastic material will gain a deep metal-like finish. In STEP 6, I'll explain pearl and metallic color painting.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Pearl and Metallic Color paints are different from regular paints, they're paints with metallic and pearl particles inserted. As such, if you spray too much, the particles will end up running. To avoid the paint running, you should little-by-little build up a finish by spraying multiple thin coats. Accroding to how many coats, the color will change, so if you spray multiple coats on a test piece beforehand to check the finish, you can get closer to the finish in your mind.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>What are Pearl Paints? Pearl Colors are transparent clear paints with fine stones called mica and pearl pigments added in, and when light strikes these painted on particles they refract and reflect it in a complex manner, bringing forth a unique radiance similar to a pearl's. Also, for polarized pearls, depending on the angle light strikes it by, the color changes like it was iridescent. There are many kinds of pearl paints differing in the color of the particles, brightness, and the size of the particles, and they let you express a brilliance like a pearl that you can't do with ordinary paints.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>These were painted with Mr Crystal Color Diamond Silver, Turqoise Green, and Ruby Red on top of base coats of white and black.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>These were painted with GX Rough Silver, GX Metallic Yellow, and GX Metal Bloody Red on top of base coats of white and black.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Features of Pearl Paints For pearl paints, the light penetrating the pearl layer will change in brightness depending on the color of the base coat. Depending on the base coat's color and the number of paint coats, you can express a variety of different finishes.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Features of Metallic Paints For metallic paints, like with pearl paints, the penetrating light will reflect off the base coat and change the brightness. Depending on the base coat's color and the number of paint coats, you can express a variety of different finishes. Depending on the base coat's color and the number of paint coats, you can express a variety of different finishes.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Differences in reflection emerge depending on the color of the base coat. For pearl paints, the color of the base has a large influence. Because black absorbs light, pearl paints on top of it will be the main source of reflected light and thus increase in brilliance.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Differences in reflection emerge depending on the color of the base coat.

Using a mixing stick, properly stir it around 100 times. If you paint without stirring, the particle density won't be properly scattered, and there will be inconsistencies in the brightness of the final coat. Even when painting too, every twenty minutes you should do a backflush, so that you properly mix the pearl paint inside the cup.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Fundamentals of Metallic Paints Similar to Pearl Paints, compared to regular paints metallic paints also have large particles that settle easily, so before you use them for painting you should mix well. Use a mixing stick to stir about 100 times to mix well.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Pearl and Metallic Paint procedure and tips</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Carefully dust the part. With pearl paint, dust stands outs, so use a brush to properly dust the surface of the part. You can also use your airbrush to dust with compressed air immediately before painting just to be safe.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Spray from about 5-10 cm away. Keep the airbrush about 5-10 cm away from the part, and paint like you're gently coating the entire part in paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_13.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>For metallics, it's 8-10 cm away.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Keep in mind that you should be coating the entire part evenly with pearl particles as you paint. Set the regulator's air pressure to 0.1 - 0.15 MPa (Megapascal), and spray while being conscious of how you should be evenly coating the part in pearl particles.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>4. Line up fellow parts together to compare their coloring conditions. Line up fellow painted parts, and compare them to see if their coloring is the same.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Point: Take care not to spray too much paint and make it run. For metallic paints, because the particles run so easily, take care not to repeatedly spray too much when painting. If you spray a large amount in one coat, the paint will run, and pool along the part's edges and its inner sections. If on top of a surface you painted with metallic color you slightly sand it, that alone can end up changing the feel of the part [if you use sandpaper to correct the error, that alone can ruin the finish]. When recovery is essential, you can use thinner to remove all of the paint, then redo the painting.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcc_14.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Maintenance Methods after using pearl/metallics Differing from regular paints, pearl and metallic type paints have coarse particles, so just doing the airbrush cleaning described in STEP1 alone will end up leaving some particles in the interior. After doing a basic washing, take apart the airbrush and clean the interior. This is useful also for when the paint has clogged, or if it's hardened inside the airbrush. When airbrushing for long periods of time, to use it pleasantly, be sure to properly maintain it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For pearl and metallic paints, due to being paints containing coarse particles, even if you wash it repeatedly there will still be paint remaining inside the airbrush cup.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_C_C","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
