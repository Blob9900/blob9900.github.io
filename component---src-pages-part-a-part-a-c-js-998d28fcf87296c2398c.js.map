Wherever you paint, ventilation is necessary so you don't inhale paint or thinner. [Paint booths are the easiest way to improve ventilation.]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Here's what I'd consider the ideal workspace. But since everyone's situation is different, don't worry if you can't replicate this. Treat it as a reference.</p>\r\n    \r\n        <ol>\r\n          <li>Painting Booth</li>\r\n          <li>Air Compressor</li>\r\n          <li>Air Regulator</li>\r\n          <li>Airbrush</li>\r\n          <li>Airbrush Stand</li>\r\n          <li>Paint</li>\r\n          <li>Thinner</li>\r\n          <li>Paint Stirrer + Paint Dish</li>\r\n          <li>Tissue Paper</li>\r\n          <li>Newspaper</li>\r\n          <li>Garbage Can</li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n\r\n        <p>Your workspace should be in a bright place near a window. All of the essential equipment should be within arm's reach. You'll also want a garbage can with a lid nearby so you can throw away tissue paper without worrying about the fumes from the thinner. Laying down newspaper to keep your desk clean is also important.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h1>Thinning your paint.</h1>\r\n\r\n        <p>Right out of the jar, paint is too thick to spray. You'll need to use the appropriate thinner to dilute it first.</p>\r\n        <p>This book uses lacquer paints, since they come in many colors and form a strong bond with parts. For lacquers, a thinning ratio of 1 part paint to 3 parts thinner should be enough for airbrushing.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>1. Stir the paint. Open the paint jar and then stir with a mixing stick. Stir until the pigment and the thinner reach a uniform consistency.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>2. Pour paint into the paint dish. Pour the paint into a paint dish before thinning. This will make checking the paint color and the dilution level easier. [If you're not precisely measuring,] pour paint until you make a puddle about the size of a 500 yen coin.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>3. Clean the jar's neck threads. Wipe away any paint left on the neck finish. If it dries, you won't be able to properly screw the cap back on.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>4. Screw on the cap. If you don't form a proper seal, the solvent in the paint will evaporate.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Using a pipet. While it's possible to pour thinner straight from the bottle, you'll usually end up overthinning. I recommend using a pipet or at least a cap with a nozzle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>1. Prepare the pipet.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>3. Mix the paint and the thinner. Use the mixing stick to mix one part paint to three parts thinner.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>How thin should your paint be? When your paint is similar in consistency to milk or soy sauce, it's suitable for airbrushing. [You should see bubbles form on the surface when you stir.]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>4. Check the airbrush cup: Before you pour in paint, check the inside of the airbrush cup for leftover paint. The thinner in the paint you're using will reactivate any dried paint and taint your color.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_11.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>5. Pour the paint into the Airbrush cup. Pour until the cup is about 2/3 full. If you pour it to the brim, the paint will overflow when you put the airbrush cap on.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Caution: Don't pour [unthinned] paint directly into the airbrush cup! If you pour paint directly into the airbrush cup, the paint will settle to the bottom. This makes it more likely the airbrush will clog.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_13.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>7. Wipe away any spillage with tissue paper. [6 is a repeat of 5]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_14.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>8. Put on the airbrush cap's lid.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Failing to properly thin your paint results in a rougher finish. Thick paint dries slower too, so it's more likely to end up with dust in the finish.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_15.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>This paint was too thick. The paint on this plaplate was thinned at a 1:2 ratio. Notice how the finish is rough.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_17.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>This paint was too thick. If you skimp on thinner, the paint will end up with a stringy consistency like in the photo.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_16.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>If during your test spray you notice the paint is too thick, add thinner to the airbrush cup with a pipet to adjust the concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_19.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>The paint was too thin. This paint was thinned at 1:5 ratio. It didn't adhere to the surface well and ran.</p> \r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_20.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Pour the paint out before adjusting concentration. Pour the paint back into a mixing dish before adding more unthinned paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_18.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Caution: Don't pour paint directly into the airbrush cup! If you pour paint directly into the airbrush cup, the paint will settle to the bottom. This makes it more likely the airbrush will clog.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>HOW TO DISPOSE OF THINNER AND EXCESS PAINT</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pac_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Do not pour thinner and paint down the sink, they'll harm the environment. Use tissue paper to soak up the liquids the paper into a garbage can with a lid. The lid is important because the thinner/paint solvent is volatile and will evaporate into fumes.</p>\r\n        <p>Keep the volatility warning in mind for the paint you actually sprayed too. After airbrushing (or handpainting, using glue, or even putty), open a window and ventilate your workspace for around an hour. Turn your spray booth on too if possible. </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    \r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_A_C","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
