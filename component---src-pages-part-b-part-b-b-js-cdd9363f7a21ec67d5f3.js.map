Here I'll explain things like the \"clips\" for painting that are used to hold parts steady in the middle of painting, and tips for lining up parts on the drying rack prior to painting.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Let's use painting clips When you're painting, I recommend using \"clips\" to hold onto the parts. If there are clips, you can paint without getting your hands dirty, and they're also useful when you're drying the parts after painting. If you hold the parts directly while painting, you'll leave fingerprints on the surface of the paint, and while you hold parts when they're in the middle of drying the efficiency will worsen. They can be easily created with materials close-at-hand, so let's prepare some ahead of time.</p>\r\n \r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Pinch the part. Pinch the part with the grip. At this time, carefully check to make sure the part won't fall off.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>As for small parts or parts with shapes that the grip can't grasp that you want to put on a clip, you can stick them to tape wound around a clip. Place the adhesive side on the chopstick, then wind the tape around, and you'll create a grip.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For parts that the grip can't grasp, you can fix the parts in place by sticking them to a clip with tape wound around it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>If grease from your fingers was attached during assembly, the paint could be repelled. Before painting, wipe the surface of the plastic model parts with an alcohol type wet tissue. [a cleaning wipe, not just wet tissue paper]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>If you've attached the parts to clips during painting preparations, you'll be able to smoothly paint. When you're lining up clips on the drying rack, a tip is that you should leave moderate space between clips like in the picture. If you line up without gaps, the fellow parts will hit against each other, and the drying parts after painting will have scratches on their surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Attach to a cardboard grip. Let's grip individual colors and prepare for painting. In STEP2, you attached to grips that used chopsticks, but because when you're painting individual colors it's necessary to prepare a ton of grips, here I'll introduce a method to paint easily.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Prepare cardboard and cloth tape (or double sided). [fabric tape] Prepare a grip that you can affix parts to. Here we'll use a grip where you've affixed cloth tape to cardboard.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Affix cloth tape to the cardboard. Affix cloth tape to the prepared cardboard. With the sticky side facing up, affix only the tips of the cloth tape to the cardboard. [Create a bridge shape]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbb_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Stick the parts to the cloth tape. On the cloth tape's sticky side, stick on parts with the side you'll paint facing up and line them up.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_B_B","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
