It's a work where, On the part's edges and grooves, you thinly spray with an airbrush shadow colors to produce a feeling of solidity. There are many places where you can tough up an already painted Gunpla, but here we'll paint on a gunpla in a simply assembled state (straightbuilt). Even if you make a mistake and spray too much, you can easily clean it off with thinner.
