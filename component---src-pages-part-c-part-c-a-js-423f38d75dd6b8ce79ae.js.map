Creating a color by mixing several paints together can be called \"mixing paints\". Here, I'll introduce tips and the process of creating colors by referencing the instruction manual's color guide.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Painting the manual's predetermined colors. On top of being able to paint with a color made by mixing together several other paints, if you have an airbrush it's enjoyable. Let's reproduce the predetermined colors of the color guides recorded in the manuals. The paints reocrded in the color guide, are designated with the names of \"Aqueous Hobby Color\" colors. In cases where the color you need isn't provided by Mr. Color, it's fine to do a color comparison at a hobby shop storefront, and prepare a color close to the predetermined color.</p>\r\n\r\n\t  \t<p>A color chart of paints recorded in the manual. The paint names and mixing ratios are indicated, so when you're making colors it's fine to use them as reference.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Prepare the necessary paints then mix. If while painting you find out you don't have enough of a color, making the exact same color is almost impossible. So you should prepare reserves ahead of time. It's fine to store created colors in spare bottles or empty paint jars.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Using the color guide as reference, gather paints. Referencing the color guide, gather the necessary paints ahead of time. Take care so that you don't run into a situation where you don't have enough of a color to mix properly.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>When mixing, do all the colors at once. [Store created paint in spare bottles] For colors, rather than making them each time you paint each color, I recommend making all of the colors at once so you can check the balance between colors more easily. </p>\t\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>I'll explain some tips for the process of making colors. When mixing, do it in a bright place. If you use paper cups when making colors, it's easier to check the color so I recommend it. For paint as there might be a lot of colors you need to combine at different ratios, it's good to add each one little by little.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>1. Mix the color well. Using a mixing stick on the paint inside the jar, mix about 50-100 times.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>2. Pour the paint into a paper cup. [If you touch a mixing stick to the jar, the paint will pour without spilling] Using a mixing stick, pour the paint into a paper cup.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>3. Wipe the jar's lid with tissue paper. Use a tissue paper to wipe away the paint on the jar lid that got attached there while pouring.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>4. Add paint and mix. To the paint you inserted into a paper cup in step 2, add another color to start mixing.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>5. Add the paint bit by bit. Using a mixing stick, add several drops at a time and mix.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>6. Once the color has been added, mix well. After adding the color, mix well then check the color.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>7. Compare with the manual to check if the color matches. Compare with the manual's color guide, and check if your color is close. When checking, do it in a bright place.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>8. Store in a spare bottle. Insert the mixed paint into a spare bottle to store it. When mixing, to avoid cases where you don't have enough paint while mid-painting session, make a larger batch ahead of time.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<StaticImage src=\"../../images/pca_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Tip: Add fluorescent paint like it was a secret ingredient. When you want to paint with vivid colors that will have an impact during photography, a secret ingredient is to add trace amounts of fluorescent paint (1-2 drops). The effects of the fluorescence will, after a few weeks or months, become no more, so even if you add a large amount of fluorescent paint the color can fade.</p>\r\n\t  </div>\r\n\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_C_A","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
