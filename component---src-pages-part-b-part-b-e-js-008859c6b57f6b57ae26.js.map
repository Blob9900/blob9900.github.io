It also comes in gloss, matte, and semi-gloss. It produces a more durable coat, but just like with lacquer paint isn't safe to spray on top of acrylic or enamel. With the latter in particular, your panel lines might run.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>What's a matte spray? [Matte spray] is a type of can spray coating that's used to finish up plastic models. A small quantity of particles of a gloss-erasing agent known as \"flat base\" create a slightly rugged appearance on the surface of the part, and by making the part diffusely reflect light gives the appearance of eliminating gloss. Upon spraying the coating agent, there is also the effect of protecting seals. It's a process that can be comparatively simply coated, and has a large effect. Beginners are encouraged greatly to try this too.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Upon eliminating the part's gloss, plastic models lose their gleaming, toy-like appearance and gain a more subdued feel.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Preparations before spraying Do these preparations so you can spray smoothly. Hold up the parts that will be sprayed with painting-use clips. Please look at pages 54~55 to learn how to create and attach painting-use clips.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Remove dust from the part. Before spraying, use a brush or large writing brush to remove dust from the surface of the part.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Shake the can and mix the contents. Shake the can spray well while it's in a condition of having its lid shut, and properly mix the contents. A rough estimate of how many times to shake is about 50 to 100 times.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For matte spray coating, tips on distance from part and how to move your hand With spraypainting with paint cans, it's essential to paint evenly, but in the case of matte sprays, even if you're a little uneven it's fine. What's essential when coating with matte spray, are the distance from the part and how you move your hands. With matte spray, you should be a little seaprate from the part, and you need to cover the whole body gently, so a tip is to spray thin coats.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Distance between the can spray and the parts. The matte spray should be about 15-20 cm away from the part, and you should spray such that you gently coat the entire part.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>This is too close to the part. If you spray too much, the paint will run. Spray with the can spray about 15-20 cm away.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>If you're too far from the part, the surface of the paint will look gritty, and it's easy to get dust particles floating in the air between caught in the spray.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Process of spraying matte coat. [wow, I'm really inconsistent with what I call this] When you start and stop spraying, the coating coming out will be unstable, so you shouldn't let it touch the part. Ideally you should gently spray it across the whole body in the form of mist. Following the shape of the part, slide the spray can across in a direction where it's easy for you to move your hands.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>In cases where you're coating vertical parts [parts in a vertical orientation? lengthy?], don't touch the part with the beginning and end of the spray, a tip is to snap your wirst and quickly spray from top to bottom. The spray should pass through the part at a speed such that you should be done in about a second.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>When spraying while moving your hand sideways [horizontal parts] In cases where you're spraying horizontal parts, don't touch the part with the beginning and end of the spray, a tip is to quickly slide your hand sideways. You should spray such that the mist gently covers the part.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>A special rule for model-use sprays</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For can sprays, as the quantity of paint coming out is unstable when you begin and stop spraying, it might let out a large quantity, and it might only let out gas. As such, only letting the stable, thin mist that comes out in the middle of spraying contact the part is a technique unique to models. If you're a beginner this may seem confusing, but if you want to get better at spray painting then you should memorize this.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Spraypainting for models is different from other things where you spray a target, like hairspray or insecticide, and has unique rules and tips.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_11.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>For joints, stretched condition, and bent condition, spray twice. First spray while it's a stretched state. Then after letting it dry for 20-30 minutes, this time spray while the joints are in a bent state. If you spray in two separate waves like this, you'll be able to evenly coat the spray.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>After Using A Can Spray After using a can spray, wipe the nozzle, put the lid on, then store it away. If the the can feels light, or when you shake it you hear a large rattling sound, then that's a sign that the contents are low. Once the inside paint and gas has been entirely sprayed, then dispose of it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_13.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Wipe the canspray's nozzle clean If paint builds up on the tip of the can spray's nozzle, paint won't be able to cleanly spray, so use a tissue or the like to wipe it off.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_14.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Empty spray the can spray. After using a can spray, while holding it upside down empty spray [spray until only clear gas is emitted] for about two seconds. Then make sure to attach the lid and set it aside. [This ensures the inner part of the nozzle is clean.]</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_15.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Spray a topcoat with an airbrush Aside from the method of spraying a matte coat with a spray can, there's also the method of spraying topcoat from inside a jar. Here, I'll explain how to spray topcoat with an airbrush to remove gleams as a finishing touch.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Effect of matte spray This a testpiece of being coated with matte sprays. The parts that haven't been coated with matte spray have a gleaming gloss, reflect light, and have a glare. In contrast, the parts that have had a matte spray blown onto them have erased the gloss, don't have a reflection or glare, and have gained a quiet, subdued feel. Due to the influence of the gloss erasing agent \"flat base\", colorful parts have the characteristic of becoming slightly whitish.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Try spraying topcoat with an airbrush. Let's spray topcoat with an airbrush, and try erasing the gleams as a finishing touch. The typical topcoat sold inside jars, assumes you will use it with an airbrush. Because you're spraying with an airbrush, you can get more fine control than with a spraycan. But, in cases where you spray with an airbrush, different from a spray can you have to spend time to thin the paint (P21), and clean the airbrush. Airbrushes and spray cans, neither is really better than th eother, just choose the one you like more. Before coating with the topcoat in jars, prepare by separating the parts and attaching them to clips.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>The attributes of matte topcoats inside jars The matte topcoat inside jars has gleam erasing agents called \"flat base\" inserted inside, so it can be used when you want to erase the gleam as a finishing touch. Ordinary topcoat in jars, because it's assumed you'll use them with airbrushes, depending on how much thinner you add you can adjust how matte it is. Because flat base settles, when using use a mixing stick and stir well around 100 times. If you don't mix it well, it may lead to it not being matte.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>For the matte topcoat inside jars, because the flat base has settled at the bottom it must be mixed well.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_16.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Preparing the topcoat for painting If you dilute inside the airbrusch cup, the flat base might clog the brush up, so always dilute inside a paper cup or another container. Keep the airbrush about 10 cm away from the part.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Use thinner to dilute the jarred topcoat. Aim for 1 part topcoat to 2 parts thinner.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_17.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Keeping the airbrush about 10 to 15 cm away, spray all over the part.</p>        \r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_18.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Gently coat the entire part. If you didn't mix the flat base well, when you spray it might cause it to become whitish. Before spraying, be sure to properly gargle.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Gently coat the entire part. When spraying topcoat with an airbrush, one tip is to gently spray the entire part. Move the airbrush up and down, and also left and right to spray the whole body. While watching the condition of the matte, coat.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbe_19.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Joint Parts For the elbows, knees, and other movable parts, coat it twice, one time stretched straight and one time bent. When bending the elnows and knees, you can protect against there being visible sections not painted.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>In a bent state, in a stretched state, spray in two separate coats First coat it while it's stretched out. After letting it dry for 20 to 30 minutes, this time bend the joints and coat. If you spray in two coats like this, you'll be able to spray evenly.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_B_E","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
