Go to page 44 for airbrush cleaning methods.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>if previously painted paint remains inside the airbrush then it could end up mixing colors, because of this backflush (see pg. 36) and clean the inside of the cup.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t    <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Phase 1</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>1. Paint the rim. Dust the part, then start spraying the part's rim and panel limes.

If the base color is dark, then if you want to paint bright colors like white or yellow on top of it, if necessary I recommend painting a base coat of base white.</p>\r\n\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_17.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>In order to cleanly produce color, paint a white basecoat. On the left is a part that was painted as is without a base coat. On the right is a part where red was painted on top of a basecoat of white. The difference in coloring is obvious.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Base Coats When you want to paint a color different from the base color on top of the base color, I'll explain the tip of painting a base coat to minimize the effect of the base color. Since bright colors like white or yellow receive influence easily, in cases where you're painting on top of darker base colors you should spray a basecoat.</p>\r\n\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_18.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_19.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>The base color makes an influence and slight differences emerge in the expressing of color When you want to paint parts with a different base color the same color, it's possible that the base color makes an influence and slight differences emerge in the expressing of color. Like in the picture, if you paint with the base color as is, after painting the color could end up getting darker. If you painted with a base coat of white, they'd all be the same color, which is good.</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>Process of painting a base coat So that the color won't receive influence from the base color and darken, paint a base coat with \"Base White\", a white paint used for base coats that has high \"masking power\", the power to hide away the base color.</p>\r\n\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_20.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>The white base coat material \"base white\" Compared to other paints, it has the characteristic of having a high \"masking power\".</p>      \r\n\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_21.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>Spray with an airbrush. Diluting to about 1 part paint to 3 parts thinner, spray with an airbrush.</p>\r\n\r\n      <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcb_22.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>Check the condition of the color. Build up 3-4 coats, so that the white properly expresses it self.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_C_B","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
