Because you can easily correct, deal with it without panicking.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Dust has gotten on the part In times when dust got on the part during painting, let it dry for about 20 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Cut sandpaper Use scissors to cut an easy-to-use strip of 1000 grit sandpaper. For that cut sandpaper, fold it into three layers to give it a thickness that makes it easy to use.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Shave away at the spot where dust is attached with the sandpaper. Gently touching the sandpaper to the part, shave away at the spot where the dust is attached. Just a bit of shaving will loose the dust, but check very carefully. Once there's no more dust, the correction is complete. Use an airbrush to re-apply paint to the corrected section.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>When the paint has run If you sprayed paint in large quantities and it ran, or if dust is attached but the part is in a complex shape where it'd be difficult to use sandpaper to shave away, submerge the part in thinner and dissolve the paint. Using a writing brush, carefully wash out the parts' paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>A part where the paint ran. If you airbrushing too much paint, the paint can run. If this happens, it's best to just remove the paint entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Prepare thinner The part will be soaked in thinner to dissolve the paint. Pour the thinner into a metal dish.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Soak the part with paint that ran in thinner. If you leave it like that for about 1 minute, the paint the should dissolve. If it soaks for too long, it's possible the part could crack, or the surface could melt, so be careful. Gently brush with a writing brush to clean the part surface's paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_11.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>After pulling the part out of the thinner, wipe it with tissue paper.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pcd_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Mistakes happen often in painting. When you spray too much paint, the first thing to do is to stop your hand and let it dry properly. Don't make a mistake and try to wipe it off in a hurry. If cracks or dust get on half-dried paint, the damage will end up magnified. First you should let it dry and let the paint coat harden. There are many ways to correct mistakes, so don't panic, calm down, and deal with them.</p>\r\n\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_C_D","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
