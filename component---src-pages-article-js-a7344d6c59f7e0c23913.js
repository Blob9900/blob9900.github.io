In the beginning, I used Tamiya's HG Compressor Revo. Even if I wanted to raise the air pressure, I couldn't. I think it outputted around 0.08 Mpa? Back then, I used GSI Creos' Mr. Color paints like it was a matter of course, and also their yellow label Leveling Thinner as the solvent. Shopkeepers recommended them to me so I bought them, and just as Kentarou-san said, it was written in guidebooks to paint with a 1:3 paint-to-thinner ratio. After I did that, the paint was so watery that I couldn't spray it that well, so I  gradually thickened it. Back then I sprayed at about 1:2. I was even questioned about it when I was in the Net Modelers (a Gunpla builder team), \"why do you have the paint that thick?\" I also asked around a lot, and found that back then most people didn't use Leveling Thinner, they used the ordinary thinner. So I figured \"Man~, I guess the thinning ratio changes if you use ordinary thinner\". And then after that I met Finisher's."),n.createElement("p",null,"With Finisher's paint, if you tried to use it the same way as the Mr. Color paints of the time, it was thick.

Despite that, even though it was paint at a thickness I'd never sprayed before, it sprayed just fine. It had a shine to it, and its hiding power was novel. In the old days, you'd have to spray countless coats to lay down white. But with Finisher's Foundation White, just two coats would hide the base color. I was like, \"what the hell?\".  From then on I started mainly using thick paints, and if I found a compressor that could output higher pressure than I switched to it. And so today, even though my dilution ratio has gotten thicker than ever, I can spray it."),n.createElement("p",null,"This is changing the subject, but I primarily use Tamiya's spray cans for my surfacer. It goes without saying, but with a spraycan you can't adjust the pressure like with an airbrush, right? But if you use it right, you can paint cleanly thanks to the surface tension from blasting out all that thick paint at once. Typically a lot of the paint will stick to the majority of the surface fine, but it won't adhere that well at the edges. But if your spraying technique is good, the edges will stand strong even after painting. So what if I brought that reasoning to airbrushes...? Working off that question to myself, I did a lot of trial-and-error to figure out how to spray easier. I ended up thinning with Gaia Notes' Brush Master at around 1:2."),n.createElement("p",null,"With that said, recently I've changed my preferences to Quattroporte's Tipo Multi Thinner, and now I can spray even thicker. I'd say around 1:1.5 to 1:1.7 or so? 1:1 makes me go \"that's thick\". I have to consider the condition of the paint too, which can differ depending on the color. Red turns watery if I add too much thinner, and blue is similarly at risk. White is fine. As a rule I don't mention numbers like this, I just leave it to instinct. Listen to the sound when it sprays, look at the smoothness of the paint surface... Well, that's going too far. I have a rule of thumb paint-to-thinner ratio, I just change it up every now and then."))),n.createElement("section",{className:"section"},n.createElement("div",{className:"container"},n.createElement("h2",null,"There's a fixed thickness to a proper coat of paint.",n.createElement("br",null),"Spray it all at once to work faster."),n.createElement("p",null,"nishi: ...Wait, keita-san said everything already (laughs).

Simply put, if you don't dilute your paint as much, you can finish in less coats. As far as layering methods go, it's easy to produce differences in color. I think there's a fixed thickness to the paint at the point when the color has been laid down properly. Whether you sprayed 5 coats or 1 coat, if the color is the same then the thickness is the same. So in that case, can't you finish faster by spraying thicker concentrations? As for clean finishes or glossy surfaces, I've achieved both of those in practice, so I think I have a feel for what a suitable thickness should be."),n.createElement("p",null,"What keita-san mentioned about spray cans applies to me too, but I'd like to point out that when you paint, the edges get covered too. So if you layer multiple coats, all of that's building up on the edges and gradually killing it. So to avoid that, I think you should paint all at once so that the edges won't get coated more than necessary. And there's that, gap filling trick, right? When you spray surfacer and then sand it off [to fill in defects on the part]. I never do that either. No matter how carefully you do it, there will be parts of the edges you can't reach. They're sure to die."),n.createElement("p",null,"Other than that, I'm about the same as keita-san, I think? The change in paint too. Before 2005 I used the old Mr. Color jars with convex caps, and then various things changed with Finisher's paint. I had to stick with Mr. Color for painting gradients, though, because the hiding power of Finisher's paint was too strong. So you could say keita-san and I had our painting styles specialize into flat coats."),n.createElement("p",null,"keita: I know it's nishi-san's turn, but I used to fill gaps with surfacer. It was to repair the damage to the plastic surface I caused by sanding with 240 grit sandpaper. I thought it was fine back then. I didn't care as much about precise details as I do now. Kits back then were usually plain too, so I used painting techniques involving gradients like the MAX method. The whole concept of trying to produce clean edges basically didn't exist. But as kits started becoming as highly detailed as they are now, the two of us started gradually shifting to flat coats. Based on the geometry of the surface, you can use a variety of colors to express a single color. Taking white as an example, the spots with shadow are gray, the spots with lighter shadow are light gray, and the bright spots are white. If you paint a gradient, doesn't that niceness just die away?

Normally, I use an 0.3 mm, a 0.2 mm, and a 0.18 mm. They're for painting shading. Actually, the painting method can change depending on the color. For example, with paints like cobalt blue that have weak hiding power, if the base color isn't sky blue or purple, I always thin at a 1:1 ratio. Also, here's something where keita-san and I differ. When I'm painting figures I mix colors, but keita-san never mixes his paint. He's part of the faction that uses paint straight out of the jar.
