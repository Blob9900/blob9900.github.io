As a transparent color, the plastic below it will show through, making it a natural fit for finishing touches. Before shading, spray towards a piece of paper first, practice drawing lines and gain a sense for it.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>Shading Tips On the part's edges, engraved lines, and deeper parts, paint the shadow color. Before painting, look at the part's conditions, if you ascertain where you should spray shadow color before working, the work will proceed smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_01.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Distance between part and airbrush The airbrush's tip should be in a state where it is separated by about 3-5 cm as you spray the paint.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_02.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Be careful not to spray too much. If the airbrush is too close, or the amount of paint sprayed is too much, the paint can run.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_03.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Paint the part's edges Paint the shadow color smoke gray on the part's edges. A tip is to paint just a bit, then stop your hand, and ascertain the deepness of the shadow color.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_04.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Paint the shadow color on the part's seams. When painting the seams, if you proceed while the kit is assembled to some extent, it's easier to properly adjust the shadow color's balance.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_05.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Point: Change the shadow color's depth to match to the base color's color When shading white or bright-colored parts, be careful not to make it too dark. If you're unsatisfied with the condition, it's possible to add more later. But again, be careful not to spray too much. When painting shadow color on parts that are red or blue, or otherwise enticing, there may be a situation where 1 coat of paint only isn't enough to be visible, so keeping an eye on the appearance spray repeatedly to build up color.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_06.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_07.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Shade the edges. Holding the airbrush ~3cm away, lightly shade the part's edges. Do this repeatedly, and gradually build up color. Keep an eye on the part's overall color balance as you do this, and try to limit your hand motions to straight lines.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_08.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Shade the panel lines. Shade the part's panel lines to add the illusion of shadow. If the part ever starts to look a bit glossy, stop and let the paint dry.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_09.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Gradually build up color. Spray multiple light coats, gradually building up color. Keep an eye on the part's overall color balance as you paint to avoid one section looking deeper than the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_10.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Don't try to spray everything on at once. If you apply the shading in a single coat, the paint could run. If that happens, wipe it off with a tissue and start over.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_11.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Don't go out of bounds. If the shading spills out of the edges and panel lines, the result will look aimless and stand out badly.</p>\r\n\r\n        <StaticImage src=\"../../images/pbc_12.jpg\" placeholder=\"blurred\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>What to do if you make a mistake while shading? If you spray too much shadow and the color becomes deep, if the paint ends up running, or other times where things don't go smoothly, wipe it away with Mr. Color Thinner and start over again. Soak up the Mr. Color thinner with a cotton swab, and wipe away the paint in the mistaken parts. At this time, take care not to end up spreading the paint around. Because you painted on the bare plastic, even if you make a mistake it's relatively easy to start over. Don't be afraid of failure and challenge yourself.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      </Layout>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}"],"names":["Part_B_D","className","S","src","placeholder"],"sourceRoot":""}
